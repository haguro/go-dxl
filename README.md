# Go-DXL

*Note: This library is still in early development. Features and API are subject to change. Use at your own risk.*

go-dxl is a Go library for interfacing with the ROBOTIS DynamixelÂ® actuators. It aims to include a set of packages to communicate with Dynamixel devices at different levels of abstraction. It currently contains the following packages:

1. protocol (In progress) - low level communication with Dynamixel actuators  using the Dynamixel Protocol 1.0 and 2.0.

## Features

- Zero external dependencies: All packages in this library will only ever depend on other packages within this library and/or on the Go standard library.
- Lightweight: All packages should aim to have minimal memory footprint and computational overhead [Planned]
- TinyGo support: Whenever possible, the packages shall be designed to support compilation to TinyGo (only for standard targets - microcontroller targets are under consideration and will be decided upon as more packages are added) [Planned]
- Simple API: The API shall aim to be simple and easy to use while exposing all functionality. [Planned]
- Abstraction layer support for all Dynamixel servo families: The protocol package will support low level communication for all Dynamixel servo families (AX, MX, XM, XH, PRO/PRO-M) via implementation of the Dynamixel protocol versions 1 [Planned] and 2 [Done]. Higher level packages wil abstract away differences between servo families. [Planned]
Servo simulator support: Allow simulation of Dynamixel servos and their response to commands without requiring physical hardware. [Planned]
